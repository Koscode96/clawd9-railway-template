## Maintenance Requests

### Triage Flow

**Step 1: Understand the Issue**
```
Thanks for letting us know about this. So I can help quickly, could you tell me:

1. What exactly is the problem?
2. Which room/area is affected?
3. When did you first notice it?
4. Is it affecting your ability to use the property normally?

A photo or video would also be really helpful if you can send one.
```

**Step 2: Assess Urgency**

🔴 **EMERGENCY (Respond within 1 hour):**
- Gas leak or smell of gas
- No heating (in winter) or hot water
- Flooding or burst pipes
- Total loss of electricity
- Security breach (broken locks, smashed windows)
- Fire or fire damage
- Sewage backup

🟡 **URGENT (Respond within 24 hours):**
- Partial heating failure
- Leaking (but contained)
- Broken appliance (oven, fridge)
- Toilet not flushing (if only toilet)
- Pest sighting

🟢 **ROUTINE (Respond within 5 working days):**
- Minor leaks
- Cosmetic issues
- Appliance issues (non-essential)
- Garden/external issues
- General wear and tear

**Step 3: Emergency Response**
```
🚨 This sounds like an emergency. Here's what to do:

[For gas leak:]
1. Do NOT use any electrical switches
2. Open windows and doors
3. Turn off gas at the meter if safe
4. Leave the property
5. Call National Gas Emergency: 0800 111 999
6. Call us/landlord once safe

I'm escalating this to our emergency team now. Someone will call you within [timeframe].

Are you safe right now?
```

**Step 4: Urgent Response**
```
Thanks for reporting this. I've logged it as urgent and our team will be in touch within 24 hours to arrange access for a contractor.

In the meantime:
[Relevant interim advice based on issue]

Is there a best time for someone to come? Any access instructions we should know about?
```

**Step 5: Routine Response**
```
Thanks for letting us know. I've logged this and someone will be in touch within 5 working days to arrange a visit.

Reference: [TICKET-XXXX]

Is there anything else you'd like to report while we're at it?
```

### Common Issues - Quick Responses

**Boiler not working:**
```
Sorry to hear about the boiler. Before we send someone out, could you check:
1. Is the thermostat turned up and set to "on"?
2. Is there credit on the gas meter (if prepay)?
3. Have you tried the reset button (usually on the front panel)?
4. Is the pressure gauge between 1-1.5 bar?

If you've tried all that and it's still not working, I'll arrange an engineer visit.
```

**Blocked drain:**
```
For blocked drains, you can often fix it yourself:
1. Try a plunger first
2. Pour boiling water down the drain
3. Use a drain unblocker product from any supermarket

If it's still blocked after trying these, or if it's the main drain/multiple drains are affected, let me know and I'll get someone out.
```

**Smoke alarm beeping:**
```
That beeping usually means the battery is low. The fix:
1. Press and hold the test button to stop the beeping
2. Replace the 9V battery
3. Test it works by pressing the button again

If it's a hard-wired alarm or keeps beeping with a new battery, let me know.
```
