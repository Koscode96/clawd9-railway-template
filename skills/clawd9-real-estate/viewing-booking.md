Just to confirm the details:

### Step 4: Reminder Messages

**24 Hours Before:**
```
Hi [Name], just a reminder about your viewing tomorrow:

🕐 [Time]

Looking forward to showing you around. If anything's changed, just let me know.
```

**2 Hours Before:**
```
Hi [Name], see you in 2 hours for your viewing at [Short Address]. 

The property is [any access notes - e.g., "on the second floor, buzzer code 123" or "parking available on the drive"].

Any questions before we meet?
```

### Step 5: Post-Viewing Feedback (Send 2 hours after viewing)
```
Hi [Name], hope you enjoyed viewing [Property Address] today!

I'd love to hear your thoughts:

1. Overall, what did you think? (Love it / Like it / Not for me)
2. What did you like most?
3. Any concerns or questions?
4. Would you like to book a second viewing or make an offer?

Your feedback helps us find you the perfect property!
```

## Feedback Handling

**Positive Feedback:**
```
That's great to hear! [Property Address] is getting a lot of interest.

Would you like to:
a) Book a second viewing (perhaps at a different time of day)?
b) Discuss making an offer?
c) See similar properties in the area?

Let me know and I'll arrange it.
```

**Negative Feedback:**
```
Thanks for being honest - it's really helpful to know what works and what doesn't.

Based on what you've said, I think you might prefer [alternative property suggestion] which has [feature they wanted] / doesn't have [feature they disliked].

Would you like me to send you the details?
```

**No Response to Feedback Request (Follow up after 24 hours):**
```
Hi [Name], just checking in after your viewing at [Property Address] yesterday.

Would love to hear your thoughts when you have a moment - even a quick "loved it" or "not for me" helps!

```

## Rescheduling & Cancellations

**Rescheduling Request:**

No problem at all - let's find a better time.

I have availability on:

Which works best for you?
```

**Cancellation:**
```
That's absolutely fine, thanks for letting me know.

Would you like me to:
a) Rebook for another time?
b) Send you details of similar properties?
c) Keep you on our mailing list for new properties in [area]?

Just let me know!
```

**No-Show (Check in 15 minutes after scheduled time):**
```
Hi [Name], I'm at [Property Address] for your viewing. Are you still able to make it, or would you like to reschedule?

No worries either way - just let me know!
```

## Calendar Integration

When checking availability, consider:
- Agent working hours (typically 9am-6pm, some Saturdays)
- Travel time between properties (minimum 30 mins between viewings)
- Property access restrictions (tenant notice periods, key collection)
- Block viewings where possible (multiple viewers, same time slot)

## Viewing Types

**Accompanied Viewing (Default):**
- Agent meets client at property
- Full tour and Q&A
- 20-30 minutes typical duration

**Block Viewing:**
- Multiple parties, same time slot
- Creates urgency
- Used for high-demand properties

**Virtual Viewing:**
- Video call walkthrough
- For out-of-area buyers
- Pre-qualifies before in-person visit

**Second Viewing:**
- Bring partner/family
- More detailed inspection
- Often leads to offers

## Compliance Notes

- Confirm ID for all viewings (anti-money laundering)
- Tenant-occupied properties: ensure proper notice given
- Vacant properties: security protocols for key handling
- Never leave viewers unattended in occupied properties
